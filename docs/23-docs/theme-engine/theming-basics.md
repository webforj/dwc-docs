# Theming Basics

BBj UI is easily customizable and modifiable to fit a brand. The UI is built with CSS and includes pre-baked default styles that are simple to change and modify.


## CSS Variables

[CSS Variables](/theme-engine/css-variables) are entities defined by the BBj Theme Engine that contain specific values, and are used by all BBj components to apply an consistent styling. CSS Variables are the foundation of BBj's theme engine and its customizability.

## CSS Shadow Parts

A part attribute can be assigned to any element in a [shadow tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shadow_tree). This is used to expose an element outside of the shadow tree. BBj employs [Shadow parts](/theme-engine/css-shadow-parts) to give developers more control over component customizations.

## Branding

BBj UI includes a [color palette](/theme-engine/colors?id=the-palette) that can be used to customize an application to match a brand or color scheme. The default theme has a light background but everything is fully customizable See [Themes](/theme-engine/themes) for more information on branding.
