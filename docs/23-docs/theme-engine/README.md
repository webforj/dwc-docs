# BBj Theme Engine

For all applications and components, BBj includes an evolving default theme that can be customized to meet your visual style requirements.

CSS variables (aka design tokens) such as colors, typography, borders and other visual styles are defined by the theme engine as the basic building blocks for component styles.

The theme can be customized to meet your visual style needs by modifying the [CSS Variables](theme-engine/css-variables) that it exposes as its public API.

The CSS variables are documented in the following sections:

- Typography
  - [Font family](theme-engine/typography?id=font-family)
  - [Font weight](theme-engine/typography?id=font-weight)
  - [Font size](theme-engine/typography?id=font-size)
  - [Line height](theme-engine/typography?id=line-height)
- Sizing and Spacing
  - [Sizing](theme-engine/sizing-and-spacing?id=sizing)
  - [Spacing](theme-engine/sizing-and-spacing?id=spacing)
- Style
  - [Border](theme-engine/style?id=borders)
  - [Border Radius](theme-engine/style?id=border-radius)
  - [Shadows](theme-engine/style?id=shadow)
  - [Cursors](theme-engine/style?id=cursors)
  - [Surfaces](theme-engine/style?id=surfaces)
  - [Disabled State](theme-engine/style?id=disabled-state)
